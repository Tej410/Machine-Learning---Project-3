The project involves applying Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify capacitors as passing or failing quality control (QC) based on two tests. 
The dataset contains 118 examples where red Xs represent failed capacitors and green circles represent passed ones. 
The assignment requires implementing and comparing both methods to determine which is more effective for this classification task. 

The Jupyter Source file named Project 3, contains the source code to this Project.
